Simple Clipping and knockout test.

This test sets up a simple clipping group with the first shape drawn forming the clipping region.
The clip region also contains a knockout group where one semi transparent path completely knocks out the other.

Please refer to comments in the code and the accompanying annotated diagram for further information.
